# AI-projects
The AI School Projects Repository is a collection of diverse projects developed to explore and apply artificial intelligence (AI) concepts across different domains.
These projects serve as practical demonstrations of AI techniques learned in educational settings, ranging from introductory courses to advanced research projects.
Through experimentation and hands-on implementation, students gain valuable insights into AI algorithms, methodologies, and their real-world applications.
